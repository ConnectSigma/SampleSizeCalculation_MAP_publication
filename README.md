# SampleSizeCalculation_MAP_publication
The scripts for the sample size calculation of clinical trials with binary and normal outcomes analyzed with the approach are presented. The scripts for the sample size calculation of ANCOVA models analyzed with the MAP approach are not presented here because the data should be requested from ADCS data sharing committee at https://www.adcs.org/data-sharing/. The procedure is similar to those in cases with binary and normal outcomes. Readers can refer to the scripts for the implementation of the MAP approach in ANCOVA models at https://github.com/QiHongchao/MAP_ANCOVA_publication.
