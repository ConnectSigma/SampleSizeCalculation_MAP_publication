1. simulation_preparation_normal.R: simulation setting.
2. samplesize_normal_..R: simulation for the sample size calculation with different methods, including no borrowing, MAC, and MAC unbalanced.
3. summary_results_normal.R: to derive the saved sample size of the MAP approach in the normal case using power curves and linear interpolation.
