##MAP approach
model {
for (j in 1:J) {
  ##logit_p0 in the jth historical control arm
  logit_p0_historical[j] ~ dnorm(logit_p0, 1/between_sd^2)
  p0_historical[j] <- 1/(exp(-logit_p0_historical[j]) + 1)
  event_historical[j] ~ dbin(p0_historical[j], nsub_historical[j])
}

##Overall mean of logit_p0, a large sd in log-odds scale is 2, the precision of a noninformative prior is 1/4
logit_p0 ~ dnorm(0, 1/4)

##Between-study heterogeneity
between_sd ~ dnorm(0, prec_between_sd)T(0,)

##New control proportion
logit_p0_new ~ dnorm(logit_p0, 1/between_sd^2)
